This repo is all about my attempts at understranding  basic git commands.

This are the steps taken;

  --- Create a new repo in GitHub
  --- Create a local folder 
  --- Navigate to that folder's directory using 'cd <local-folder-directory>'
  --- Initialize git via running 'git init' command
  --- link the local repository/ folder with the GitHub repo via   'git remote add origin <url-of-the-GitHub-repo>'
  --- I then created a new hello.txt file.
  --- To capture the change the command  'git add hello.txt' was crucial.
  --- Then "git commit -m <message>" helped in commiting my changes.
  --- I then had to specify the branch with the command 'git branch -M main'
  --- Finally I ran the command "git push -u -f origin main" to push to GitHub
